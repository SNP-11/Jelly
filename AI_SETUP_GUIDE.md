# AI Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
Your time management application now includes AI-powered features using OpenAI to help middle schoolers with:

1. **Smart Duration Suggestions** - AI analyzes task descriptions and suggests realistic completion times
2. **Dynamic Point Calculation** - Points are awarded based on task difficulty, completion time, and performance
3. **Task Completion Validation** - AI determines if enough time has passed for reasonable completion
4. **Personalized Insights** - AI provides study recommendations based on completion patterns

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure OpenAI API Key
1. Get an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Open the `.env` file in your project root
3. Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
```

### 3. Test the Integration
1. Start your Flask application:
```bash
python gateway.py
```

2. Create a new task and try the "ðŸ¤– Get AI Time Suggestion" button
3. Complete a task to see AI-calculated points and feedback
4. Click "ðŸ¤– AI Insights" to view personalized recommendations

## Features Explained

### AI Duration Suggestions
- When creating a task, enter a description and click the AI suggestion button
- The AI considers the student's age (default: 13) and task complexity
- Suggestions include difficulty rating, subject category, and reasoning
- Falls back to rule-based suggestions if AI is unavailable

### Dynamic Point System
- Points are no longer fixed at 10 per task
- AI considers:
  - Task difficulty (1-5 scale)
  - Time accuracy (how close actual time was to estimated)
  - Speed bonus (finishing early)
  - Urgency multiplier
  - Subject complexity
- Points range from 5-50 based on performance

### Task Completion Validation
- AI analyzes if enough time has passed for reasonable completion
- Prevents "rushing" through tasks
- Provides encouraging feedback based on performance
- Validates completion timing against task complexity

### AI Insights Dashboard
- Shows completion statistics and performance score
- Identifies patterns in study habits
- Provides personalized recommendations
- Tracks subject variety and urgency patterns

## Configuration Options

### AI Model Settings (config.py)
```python
AI_MODEL = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'  # Can change to 'gpt-4' for better results
AI_MAX_TOKENS = 150         # Response length limit
AI_TEMPERATURE = 0.7        # Creativity level (0.0-1.0)
```

### Fallback Behavior
- If OpenAI API is unavailable, the system falls back to rule-based logic
- All features continue to work without AI, just with less personalization
- Error handling ensures the app remains stable

## API Endpoints

### New AI Endpoints:
- `POST /ai/suggest-duration` - Get task duration suggestions
- `POST /ai/calculate-points` - Calculate dynamic points for completed tasks
- `POST /ai/validate-completion` - Validate task completion timing
- `GET /ai/insights` - Get personalized study insights

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **AI suggestions not working**
   - Check your OpenAI API key in `.env`
   - Verify you have API credits available
   - Check browser console for error messages

2. **Points still showing as 10**
   - Make sure the AI integration JavaScript is loaded
   - Check that task completion is using the new AI system
   - Verify the task has proper start/end times

3. **Insights not loading**
   - Ensure you have completed some tasks first
   - Check that you're logged in properly
   - Verify the database has task data

### Debug Mode:
Enable debug logging by setting `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)` in gateway.py

## Cost Considerations
- OpenAI API calls cost money (typically $0.001-0.002 per request)
- For a classroom of 30 students using the app actively, expect ~$5-10/month
- Consider setting usage limits in your OpenAI account
- The system is designed to minimize API calls while maximizing value

## Privacy & Safety
- Task descriptions are sent to OpenAI for analysis
- No personal information beyond task descriptions is shared
- All data is processed according to OpenAI's privacy policy
- Consider reviewing task content before deployment in schools

## Next Steps
- Monitor usage and costs in your OpenAI dashboard
- Collect feedback from students on AI suggestions
- Consider adding more AI features like study schedule optimization
- Implement caching to reduce API calls for similar tasks
